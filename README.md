# ‚ù§Ô∏è LLM LAB ‚Äì Pragmatic AI Patterns

Welcome to the **LLM LAB** repository!

Here you'll find practical materials and assignments, designed specifically for mastering how to integrate **Large Language Models (LLMs)** into production-ready applications.

We've already kicked off with our initial **Prompt-to-SQL pipeline** assignment, and we're now refining our approach through:

- **Structured Output Generation** ‚Äì ensuring reliable, schema-driven responses from LLMs.
- **Few-Shot Learning** ‚Äì significantly improving query accuracy by guiding the LLM with clear examples.
- **Query Expansion** ‚Äì translating user-friendly or English terms into precise database fields (for example, mapping "electronics" into actual database categories such as `"telefonia"` or `"eletronicos"`).

### üéØ Our Philosophy
We‚Äôre all about practical, high-agency solutions‚Äîthis bootcamp isn't theory-driven. It's about building solutions you can trust, debug, and deploy confidently.

We firmly believe that the future belongs to full-stack developers who know how to effectively leverage LLMs in production. The assignments here reflect this vision.

### üöÄ What's Included?

- Clearly structured, step-by-step assignments.
- Debugging guides and observability best practices, including logging and telemetry techniques.
- Practical demonstrations of **Few-Shot Learning** to guide your LLM towards correct, reliable responses.
- Clear, maintainable code samples that reflect our **KISS (Keep It Simple & Smart)** approach.

### üõ† How to Use this Repo
- Follow each assignment's detailed guide located within the assignment directory.
- Use provided Python examples, schemas (Pydantic), and OpenAI Beta features.
- Leverage the provided debugging and logging examples to improve and troubleshoot your implementations.

### üí¨ Need Help?
Feel free to reach out asynchronously via our private community chat, or directly if you have specific questions or ideas to discuss.

I'm excited to guide you through this journey of practical AI implementation. Let's build the future together!
